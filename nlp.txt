👉 What is Natural Language Processing (NLP)? ✅

    Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans through natural language. It involves the development of algorithms and models that enable computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language.

👉 History of NLP

    Early Developments: Initial efforts and rule-based approaches.
    Statistical Methods: Introduction of probabilistic models and machine learning.
    Modern NLP: Use of deep learning and advanced algorithms.


👉 Steps of Natural Language Processing ✅
    get Data ✅
    Clean Data ✅
    Tokenization --> convert Sentance into Single Word as Tokens ✅
    Stemming   --> convert the word into base or root words ✅
    lemmatization --> 100% accurate To find Root Word ✅
    post tags  --> add tags according to the part of speech ✅
    Name Entity Relationships --> making sense correctly by partition the noun etc ✅
    Chunking's --> converting the words into meaningFull sentences ✅
		  		
👉 Key Components of NLP ✅

    Phonology: The study of sounds in language. ✅
    Morphology: The study of word formation and structure --> words of root ✅
    Syntax: The study of sentence structure and grammatical rules --> Check the sentence is it synthetically Correct or not ✅
    Semantics: The study of meaning in language --> check the sentence is meaningful or not ✅
    Pragmatics: The study of language use in context. ✅
    Discourse Analysis : checking if the previous sentences is effecting the context ✅

👉 Ambiguity In NLP ✅
    
    lexical ambiguity : same word having 2 or more meaning ✅
    Syntatical Ambiguity: a word can change the sentence ✅
    Semantic Ambiguity  : Sentence having 2 or more meanings ✅
    AnaPhoric ambiguity : a noun is replace with pronoun ✅
    Pragmatic Ambiguity : ??
	

👉 Text Pre-processing Techniques ✅

    Tokenization: Splitting text into individual words or tokens. ✅
    Stop Words Removal: Removing common words that do not contribute to meaning (e.g., "the", "and"). ✅
    Stemming and Lemmatization: Reducing words to their base or root form. ✅
    Text Normalization: Converting text to a standard format (e.g., lowercasing, removing punctuation). ✅

👉 Text Representation Methods

    Bag of Words (BoW): Representing text as a collection of word counts.
    Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF): Adjusting word counts by their importance in the document and across documents.
    Word Embeddings: Representing words as dense vectors in a continuous vector space (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe).
    Contextual Embeddings: Representing words in context (e.g., BERT, ELMo).

👉 Language Models

    N-grams: Sequences of n words used to predict the next word. ✅ p(a|b) = p(a,b)/ p(a)  or P(x₁,×2,....Xn) = P(x₁)P(x2|x₁)P(x3|×₁, X2)....P(Xn | ×₁,......,‚Xn-1)
    Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): Models that capture sequential dependencies.
    Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks: RNNs that handle long-term dependencies.
    Transformers: Models that use self-attention mechanisms to capture context (e.g., GPT, BERT).

👉 Text Classification

    Techniques for categorizing text into predefined classes.
    Sentiment Analysis: Determining the sentiment expressed in text (positive, negative, neutral).
    Spam Detection: Identifying unwanted or harmful messages.
    Topic Classification: Assigning text to a specific topic or category.

👉 Named Entity Recognition (NER)

    Identifying and classifying named entities (e.g., people, organizations, locations) in text.

👉 Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging

    Assigning grammatical labels (e.g., noun, verb, adjective) to each word in a sentence.

👉 Syntax and Parsing

    Analyzing the grammatical structure of sentences.
    Dependency Parsing: Determining the dependencies between words in a sentence.
    Constituency Parsing: Breaking sentences into sub-phrases or constituents.

    Text Summarization

    Creating concise summaries of longer texts.
    Extractive Summarization: Selecting key sentences or phrases from the original text.
    Abstractive Summarization: Generating new sentences that capture the main ideas of the text.

👉 Question Answering (QA) Systems

    Building systems that can answer questions posed in natural language.
    Fact-based QA: Retrieving answers from a knowledge base.
    Open-domain QA: Generating answers from a wide range of sources.
