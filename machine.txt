ðŸ‘‰ What is Machine Learning?

    Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that involves the use of algorithms and statistical models to enable computers to improve their performance on a task through experience.
    Key applications include classification, regression, clustering, and reinforcement learning.
